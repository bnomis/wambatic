## The oldest Enterprise Server release accepted is fixed at 3.19

Found on 2026-11-02 by `/todo-review`, from the fetch spec
(`agents/specs/fetch/spec.md`, "Server version"): `MIN_SERVER_VERSION` is
`(3, 19)`, the oldest Enterprise Server release GitHub supported on
2026-11-02, and "is raised by a release, not at run time". GitHub's "All
releases" page, read on 2026-11-02, gives 3.19 a closing date of 2026-12-09.
No item recorded raising it.

Cause: the constant in `src/wambatic/fetch/hosts.py` is set by hand, and
nothing reminds anyone when a release closes.

Fix direction: after 2026-12-09, re-read GitHub's "All releases" page, raise
`MIN_SERVER_VERSION` to the oldest release still supported, and update the
fetch spec's API block and the user guide where they name the version.
